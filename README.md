# Expo Control System

This is a simple control system made by using C++ and Object Oriented Programming.

Basically, this control system is an auxiliary software that makes the visitor's experience more enjoyable by allowing them to make purchases. All these purchases are recorded and the user earns points depending on the item they bought. When the user's total point exceeds the point limit that was set by the system beforehand, the system displays a one-question quiz related to the last expo they visited. If the user gives the correct answer, they get upgraded to VIP class and get a discount; if they give the wrong answer, they need to make a purchase before they get another chance to be upgraded to VIP class. 

In conclusion, the aim is to make people want to visit more by making the expo more entertaining for them.
